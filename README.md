# Capstone_Project-1 - "Scrapping, Analyzing, and Visualizing the Data of TATA IPL 2024"

                            Scraping, Analyzing, and Visualizing the Data of TATA IPL 2024

h4 Project Description:
This project involves web scraping the data of the TATA IPL 2024 auction, followed by analysis and visualization. The project scrapes data of the top buys in the 2024 IPL auction, processes the data into CSV files, and generates insights through data analysis and visualization.

Key Features
Web Scraping: Extracts auction data of the top buys from the IPL 2024.
Data Analysis: Analyzes the scraped data to extract insights about the teams, players, and spending.
Visualization: Uses data visualization techniques to highlight key trends in the auction data.

Files
Scrapping, analysing and Visualizing the data of TATA IPL 2024.ipynb: Jupyter notebook containing the code for scraping, analyzing, and visualizing IPL auction data.
Scrapped Data from top buys in TATA IPL 2024.csv: CSV file generated from the web scraping, containing data about the top buys from the IPL 2024 auction.

Prerequisites
Python 3.x
Jupyter Notebook
Required Libraries:
requests
beautifulsoup4
pandas
matplotlib

How It Works
Scraping: The notebook uses web scraping to fetch IPL 2024 auction data for top buys, extracting key information like player names, team, price and type. The data is then saved in a CSV file.

Analysis: The data from the auction is processed using pandas to analyze the auction trends, such as total spending by each team, most expensive players, and player distribution.

Visualization: Visualizations are created using matplotlib and seaborn to display auction trends, such as bar charts showing the top spends or pie charts showing player distribution.
